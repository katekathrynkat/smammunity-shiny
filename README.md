# Title: Big Fires and Small Mammals

# Group members: me (Kate)

# Description: In September-October 2014, a large human-ignited fire known as the King Fire scorched 39,545 ha in Eldorado National Forest, earning the distinction “mega-fire” due to its scope and intensity. Small mammal communities shifted drastically across the fire severity gradient, providing an interesting system to explore the role that these animals play in different habitats. This app will allow users to explore these relationships on their own by interacting directly with field data, and ultimately will serve as a public-friendly science communication to accompany a forthcoming publication.
